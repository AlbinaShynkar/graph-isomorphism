# graph-isomorphism
This is the project of module 7 "Algorithmic structures and efficient algorithms" developed on Python.
Project requires to create an efficient algorithm which solves symmetry and graph isomorphism problem.
The project is done in groups of two people. It was developed by me and my fellow student.

The focus of the project is on practical implementations of algorithms for the notorious
graph isomorphism problem, a problem that is still open with respect to its computa-
tional complexity. Up to now it has been not proven to be in P and neither to be NP
complete. Very recently, there was a major breakthrough result, that puts the problem
closer to P than being NP-hard [1], however. Algorithms that can decide if two given
input graphs are isomorphic or not, or algorithms that detect the (number of) symmetries
of a given graph, are useful in many practical applications: Mathematical Optimization,
Computational Biology, Fingerprints, etc. Algorithms for graph isomorphism require tech-
niques that are treated in different parts of Module 7: basic data structures to represent
graphs, efficient algorithms to manipulate and work with graphs, efficient algorithms for
partition refinements, branching algorithms, and finally, aspects of algebraic group theory
are key for efficient implementations for counting automorphisms.
